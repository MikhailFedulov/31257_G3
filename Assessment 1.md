## Current Problem and Objectives of the Project

### Background
Travel companies always strive for customer excellence in everything they do. In the dynamic world, customers' behaviour
and needs constantly change motivating companies to adapt and go beyond customer expectations in the way they interact and
build relationships. Major Travel Company (MTC) desires to improve the operations of their in-house customer management
centre (CMC), the “human-face” of the customer service, by developing a new information system. The system will influence
Relationship Managers sales and assist with the current and potential customers interactions. The system will be deployed
to assist with both, inbound and outbound calls and will be able to communicate with other enterprise systems including,
HR and customer profile creation tool Profiler Tool. The system will target a wide range of customer relationship aspects
and features call routing, Interactive Voice Response, customer-to-RM matching, customer target list generation, RM skill
score calculation, customer score calculation, and data analysis.


MTC approached us to conduct the project due diligence and develop a business report for the executive team based on the
project strategic fit.


### Objectives
For the project to be successful the following objectives have been extracted from the client’s needs of a more efficient
and robust system. Based on the information provided by the client, three primary objectives have been identified which will
influence the decision making process throughout the project life cycle: improve customer experience, increase travel
packages sales, and minimise costs of inbound calls. This report include the key information required for successful project
delivery including KPIs, stakeholder analysis, project assumptions, design workproducts and practical models, and
identifies competitive advantages that might be gained in developing the new system.

### Problem definition

### Assumptions
1. For the purpose of this project, it is assumed that customer profile creation tool Profiler Tool has been implemented,
tested, and supports communication with other enterprise systems including the new CMC system.
2. HR system that creates profiles for Relationship Managers upon hiring and is capable of building matrices for each
employee that later can be communicated to other enterprise systems including the new CMC system.
3. Project is approved and passed financial due diligence.
4. The project rollout is well thought out by the implementation team to minimise CMC downtime.



### KPIs
To measure the project success and whether the project objectives have been satisfied, the new system performance needs
to be monitored over a period of 1 year and analysed against the performance of the legacy software.
