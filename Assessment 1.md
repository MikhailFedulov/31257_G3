## Current Problem and Objectives of the Project

### Background
Travel companies always strive for customer excellence in everything they do. In the dynamic world, customers' behaviour and needs constantly change motivating companies to adapt and go beyond customer expectations in the way they interact and build relationships. Major Travel Company (MTC) desires to improve the operations of their in-house customer management centre (CMC), the “human-face” of the customer service, by developing a new information system. The system will influence Relationship Managers sales and assist with the current and potential customers interactions. The system will be deployed to assist with both, inbound and outbound calls and will be able to communicate with other enterprise systems including, HR and customer profile creation tool Profiler Tool. The system will target a wide range of customer relationship aspects and features call routing, Interactive Voice Response, customer-to-RM matching, customer target list generation, RM skill score calculation, customer score calculation, and data analysis.


MTC approached us to conduct the project due diligence and develop a business report for the executive team based on the project strategic fit.



### Objectives
For the project to be successful the following objectives have been extracted from the project debrief and the client’s needs. The client desires a more efficient and robust system which will be able to distribute the CMC load accordingly now and in the future. Based on the information provided by the client, three primary objectives have been identified which will influence the decision making process throughout the project life cycle:
    1. Improve customer experience which will reflect on 2% lower churn rate after one year of operations of the new system.  
    2. Increase travel packages sales by 5% within the first year of the new system implementation.
    3. Minimise costs of inbound calls by 20% within the first year of the new system implementation.

This report includes the key information required for successful project delivery including KPIs, stakeholder analysis, project assumptions, system design including workproducts and practical models, and identifies competitive advantages that might be gained in developing the new system.


### Problem definition
#### Problem Statement
Based on the Stakeholder Analysis and POVs of each stakeholder category we have defined an overarching problem statement that incorporates various aspects of the project.

Currently, the operations of CMC relies on a lot of manual data manipulations from the working staff and its overall performance is challenging to keep a track of. Analysis of each stakeholder group indicates a need for a more robust and reliable system which can be used to better customer service.
The incremental loss in efficiency means that MTC has not been meeting its sales and portfolio goals over the last 3 years which has pushed the churn rate to alarming levels.
To reduce the CMC operations costs, increase sales and improve customer satisfaction, a new automated system will be implemented. By replacing the current manual system with a more automated one, MTC will address the existing issues and gain competitive advantage on the market.


### Assumptions
1. For the purpose of this project, it is assumed that customer profile creation tool Profiler Tool has been implemented, tested, and supports communication with other enterprise systems including the new CMC system.
2. HR system that creates profiles for Relationship Managers upon hiring and is capable of building matrices for each employee that later can be communicated to other enterprise systems including the new CMC system.
3. Project is approved and passed financial due diligence.
4. The project rollout is well thought out by the implementation team to minimise CMC downtime.  
5. The existing CMC operations rely on manual input and data manipulation from the users including, Relationship Managers, Business Analysts  and IT.
6. MTC has had an incremental loss due to low CMC efficiency. Sales and portfolio goals weren’t met in the last 3 years which led the company to reevaluate CMC operations.



### KPIs
To measure the project success and whether the project objectives have been satisfied, the new system performance needs
to be monitored over a period of 1 year and analysed against the performance of the legacy software.

### RM Interview Script
**Interviewer:** Good Afternoon I’m Hugh, I’m contacting you to get some opinions on a proposed change to our CMS(Call management System) . Do
you mind if I ask you a few questions today?  
_**RM:** Not at all go ahead_  
**Interviewer:** To start off, how are you  
_**RM:** I’m alright, especially considering everything going on recently_  
**Interviewer:** I know, glad to hear you’re doing well  
**Interviewer:** So What do you primarily use our service for?  
_**RM:** Well primarily I utilise the system to complete all my day to day tasks on the job, It’s what connects me to the customer_  
**Interviewer:** What is your biggest issue with the current system of call management?  
_**RM:** Actually I’m glad you ask, I’m finding on a few occasions that I’m being given calls outside my general area of expertise, even when colleagues with more experience in those areas are off call. Can be a real headache_  
**Interviewer:** Are there any aspects of the current system you wish to remain intact in the change?  
_**RM:** To be honest, as long as I retain control over the actual conversation with the customer in order to ensure sales, I’m happy_  
**Interviewer:** What is the most important thing you would like to see added in the new system?  
_**RM:** I’d really love to have some indication of the incoming customers general enquiry before being connected, maybe a little info from the initial connection could help_  
**Interviewer:** What is your biggest concern with the proposed project?  
_**RM:** Mainly that it becomes too complex to understand and I lose freedom in how I approach communication with the customer_  
**Interviewer:** Do you think the implementation of the new system will have noticeable hindrance to productivity during the change period?  
_**RM:** Depends how much it changes the actions I take personally during the day. If it adds too many hoops to jump through it would severely impact my productivity_  
**Interviewer:** How comfortable are you learning a new system and are there any actions that can be taken to ease this transition?    
_**RM:** Similar to my last response it depends on how much an effect it has on my day to day. If it is going to cause a lot of changes then it would be really helpful to get some training or a runthrough of the new system in a test situation rather than learning through live calls_  
**Interviewer:** What criteria do you think will be important in the grouping of RM speciality?  
_**RM:** First and foremost our job requires us to be efficient in selling to the customer, therefore I think average call time would be a good indicator, as well as this maybe grouping RM’s based on their knowledge of global regions for example, I have a great deal of knowledge on many european locations and could offer higher quality guidance in that area_  
**Interviewer:** Do you think matching Customers to you based on perceived knowledge will improve call efficiency?    
_**RM:** Oh definitely, If I’m more confident in the area the customer is looking for then I have a far greater chance of providing a great experience to them_  
**Interviewer:** Thank You so much for your time today, your feedback will be a great help and We’ll ensure it is all considered in the new systems development, have a great day  
_**RM:** Thank you, you too_

### Customer Interview Script
**Interviewer:** Good Afternoon I’m Jett, I’m contacting you to get some opinions on a proposed change to our CMS(Call management System) . Do you mind if I ask you a few questions today?  
_**RM:** No that’s quite alright_  
**Interviewer:** To start off, how are you?  
_**RM:** Good, thank you_  
**Interviewer:** I know, glad to hear you’re doing well  
**Interviewer:** So What do you primarily use our service for?  
_**RM:** I’ve called MTC previously to book holiday trips and getaways_  
**Interviewer:** What is your biggest issue with the current system of call management?      
_**RM:** During my previous interactions with the call centre I’ve experienced extended wait times and on occasion I’ve been connected with a specialist who seemed confused or surprised by some of the questions and requests I had for them_  
**Interviewer:** Are there any aspects of the current system you wish to remain intact in the change?  
_**RM:** I’m not too fussed over what changes are made so long as I’m still connected to a customer service representative fairly quickly without too much idle time. So not really_  
**Interviewer:** What is the most important thing you would like to see added in the new system?  
_**RM:** Some sort of indicator which lets me know how long until I can be serviced by a team member_  
**Interviewer:** What is your biggest concern with the proposed project?    
_**RM:** That it could fundamentally change the booking process I’m familiar with, maybe even to the point I wouldn’t feel confident in using the calling service_  
**Interviewer:** What do you look for in a call experience?  
_**RM:** Minimal waiting time, and to feel like I am talking with a team member who is able to confidently answer and queries or questions I might have_  
**Interviewer:** Currently how satisfied are you with the call time required for booking?  
_**RM:** The current wait time is okay. I can definitely understand how the lines can get busy, but it’s still frustrating when you are forced to wait for an unknown amount of time_  
**Interviewer:** On a scale of 1-10 how satisfied are you with our call representatives knowledge of what you’re seeking?  
_**RM:** I would say maybe a six or seven. The majority of interactions I’ve had with representatives have gone well, but on one or two occasions when I’ve had specific questions regarding booking packages or terms and conditions I’ve been asked to wait while my question was passed on to a supervisor or colleague. I don’t see this as a huge issue, but the whole experience would be a lot smoother if the representative was more prepared for the specific sort of questions I might have regarding the package I had specifically contacted them to book_  
**Interviewer:** What are some of the pain points you have experienced during the booking process?  
_**RM:** Like I said before, the negative areas are generally based around wait times and the reps occasionally being unable to help me without contacting a supervisor or colleague_  
**Interviewer:** Thank You so much for your time today, your feedback will be a great help and will allow us to continue to provide a fantastic service  
_**RM:** Glad to have helped!_
